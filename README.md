# Hello Customer Case

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##  Some remarks

- I made the assumption that the role was also a required selection and put required validation on it.
- The width of the form content is controlled by a media query and will show as the 800px in the design if the browser window is smaller than 1000px
- I put a fake 2sec delay on the save function in the user service to make it more realistic.
